## Quick Guide on Palette/Sprite Swapping:

- Head to the game directory (**Browse local files)**
- Paste the **'CharSelect'** image(s) _(charselect\_**CLASS**.png)_ into **'CharSelect'** directory.
- Paste the **'Animations'** image(s) _(**CLASS**\_rabbit\_**PALETTEID**.png)_ into **'Animations'** directory.

## Quick Guide on editing sprites/palettes:

(requires Clip Studio Paint or any art program that can open .clip files)

(however in the future I will try to provide _.ase files_, _.kra files in the src directory_)

- Download the source of sprite in the src directory
- Open the .clip file in Clip Studio Paint (or whatever)
- Do whatever edits, I guess lmao.
- Export as a spritesheet with only 1 row of sprites, and scale down the output by 50%.
